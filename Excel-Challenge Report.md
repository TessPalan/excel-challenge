3 Conclusions about the KickStarter Campaign:
    1. The Theater category has the most campaigns, double or more than other categories, and the most successful ones. 
        Within the theater category, the sub-category "plays" has the most successful ones and no campaign have been canceled. 
        Even though this is the most successful category, all sub-categories have failed campaigns.
    2. Even in the less successful categories, there are many sub-categories with only successful campaigns such as;
        a. Classical Music, Electronic Music, Metal, Pop, and Rock in the Music category.
        b. Tabletop Games in the Games Category.
        c. Nonfiction and Radio & Podcast in the Publishing Category.
        d. Hardware in the Technology Category.
    3. The best launch date for campaign are in the months of May and June. The highest number of successful campaigns are during those months.

The dataset consist of some limitations such as;
    1. Different currency - the average donation isn't represented in the same value
    2. We don't have the reason to why the canceled campaigns were canceled- we don't know if there's a correlation to the number of backers and donations. 


In order to further understand this dataset we can create the following graphs and tables:
    1. Correlation between Goal and Pledged money raised and the state of the campaign in order to check if campaign needed more than they thought in order to succeed.
        Count the number of campaigns that exceed their goal and were successful and the number of campaign that didn't exceed their goal and were still successful in compared to the failed campaigns in a stacked column chart.
    2. Correlation between the country of the campaign and the state. 
        Stacked Column chart of country and number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns. 


Bonus Statistical Analysis:

1. The mean of backers is meaningful while the median isn't meaningful.
    As we can see, the average of backers is larger for successful campaign than failed ones. We can assume that the more backers to the campaign the more successful it is. 
    This might be as simple as, if more people believe in the campaign there is a larger possibility for its success. 
    Since there's a big range between our max and min backers if we randomly pick one campaign there is more chance to see our standard deviation of 844 backers than our average backers of 194.
2. Looking at our standard deviation and variance we can see that our distribution is not a normal bell curve one.
    The campaigns that have many backers are skewing our curve and extending the tail of our curve.
3. We have more variability with successful campaigns than the failed ones which makes sense as
